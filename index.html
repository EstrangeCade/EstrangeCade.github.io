                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Cade Brodie. I am currently studying at Staffordshire University. My favourite subjects are Cyber Security and Website Development.</p>
                <p>I have been studying computers for around 6 years and in that time, I have had many opportunities to expand my level of knowledge and in doing so have gained a deep level of understanding of how computers operate in terms of hardware and software.</p>
                <p>I can say that I am a responsible and hard-working student. Moreover, being a sociable person, I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know interesting new individuals. I enjoy my time at university: it is nice to study; the students are very friendly and ready to help. I like to receive and deal with challenging tasks. I am a very enthusiastic student and I think this is a strong point of mine.</p>
                <p>Please visit my qualifications page to get a better idea of the goals that I have achieved.</p>

                <p>This website will be beneficial for an employer wishing to find more information about me. You can view the page source to get an idea of the knowledge that I have gained on my Website Development course, this ranges from basic things such as p tags for paragraphs to more advanced features such as implementing a service work to cache the entire webiste so that it can be viewed offline.</p>
                <p>I have listed the main benefits below in order of what is the most beneficial.</p>
                <ol type="1">

                <p>I hope that whoever visits this website can benefit in some way from it, whether that be by finding a potential employee for your company or just getting to know me and my skill set, even if this website is tailored more towards employers.</p>

                <p>Currently, I am researching 3D printers, this is because I recently acquired an Ender 3 3D printer which has consumed lots of my time due to installation, fine-tuning and getting to know how to use the 3D slicing software to print anything I desire. I have already printed many objects, Below you can see an octopus that I 3D printed after learning how to use the 3D printer.</p>

                </picture>
                <p>In the future I hope to learn more about 3D printing such as using exotic filaments to print objects with unique textures, I still have a long way to go before I can even think about doing that. I have also made modifications to my printer such as adding an automatic bed levelling sensor and a new mainboard, I still have many more upgrades planned such as adding a glass build plate to get an even more level print surface.</p>
